    "# Tutorial #1\n",
    "\n",
    "This first tutorial provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a quick introduction to density functional tight-binding (DFTB),\n",
    "- an overview of the available DFTB calculators in ASE (focusing on DFTB+),\n",

    "## Introduction to DFTB\n",
    "\n",
    "Density functional tight-binding (DFTB) is a semi-empirical electronic\n",

    "cost and easy analysis of the electronic structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DFTB0\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the main approximations with regards to DFT in the simplest DFTB flavour\n",
    "(DFTB0, also known as 'non-self-consistent charge DFTB'):\n",
    "\n",
    "- use of a minimal basis set (i.e. single-$\\zeta$, often without\n",
    "polarization functions), which are generated by compression of the\n",
    "valence orbitals $\\phi$ in the isolated, spherically symmetric atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "- simplification of the corresponding Hamiltonian matrix elements\n",

    "- condensing the remaining contributions to the total energy (i.e. other\n",

    "### DFTB2\n",
    "\n",
    "If intra- or interatomic charge transfer is important (which is usually the\n",
    "case when bonding takes place between elements with different electronegativities),\n",
    "then self-consistency needs to be introduced (i.e. to reduce the discrepancy\n",
    "between the molecular wave functions and the Hamiltonian).\n",
    "\n",
    "In second-order DFTB (DFTB2, aka self-consistent charge (SCC) DFTB), this is\n",
    "done by introducing an additional 'charge transfer' term:<br>\n",
    "$E_{ct} \\simeq \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{a,b} \\gamma(r_{ab}, U_a, U_b) \\Delta q_a \\Delta q_b$,<br>\n",
    "where the $\\Delta q$ correspond to the net charges obtained by Mulliken partioning\n",
    "of the occupied wave functions. The $\\gamma$ function varies as a function of\n",
    "the interatomic distance $r_{ab}$. For $r_{ab}=0$ (and hence $a=b$), $\\gamma$\n",
    "equals the Hubbard value of the atom (describing the on-site Coulomb interaction).\n",
    "For large separations $\\gamma$ is such that the $a$-$b$ interaction is that of two\n",
    "spherically symmetric, exponentially decaying charge distributions (with the decay\n",
    "also being governed by the $U$ parameter). The above equation uses a single $U$ value\n",
    "for each element, but one may also introduce different Hubbard values for the different\n",
    "angular momenta for each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "The corresponding correction to the Hamiltonian is as follows:<br>\n",
    "$\\Delta\\mathcal{H}_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathcal{S}_{\\mu\\nu}\n",
    "\\sum_c \\left(\\gamma_{ac} + \\gamma_{bc}\\right) \\Delta q_c$,<br>\n",
    "leading the a self-consistent charge (SCC) cycle in the DFTB calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ... And beyond\n",
    "If also the charge-dependence of the Hubbard values is taken into account,\n",
    "one arrives at third-order DFTB (DFTB3). Quite a few extensions to (GGA-)DFT\n",
    "(such as dispersion interactions, Hartree-Fock exchange, Hubbard corrections,\n",
    "and TD-DFT) can also be applied to DFTB.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "DFTB has found many applications in diverse areas, ranging from organic chemistry\n",
    "and biochemistry, semiconductor physics, and transition metal compounds. Materials\n",
    "where the basic DFTB approximations are too crude are for example metals such as\n",
    "Li And Al where the nearly-free electrons are not well described at all in a\n",
    "a minimal AO-like basis.\n",
